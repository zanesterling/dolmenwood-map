# Dolmenwood Map

## How to use
1. Download and unzip the repository.
2. Get a copy of the map and campaign book from [Necrotic Gnome's Patreon](http://patreon.com/m/4790827/posts).
    1. The hex map is from [Content Package 16](https://www.patreon.com/posts/content-package-67077916). It should work with newer/older versions of the hex map too.
    1. The campaign book should be the one from [the June update](https://www.patreon.com/posts/campaign-book-68360535) (note: the compiled books are only available for Woodgrue-level patrons).
2. Copy your map and campaign book into the directory, next to `index.html`.
    1. The map **MUST** be named `Dolmenwood Referee's Map.png`.
    1. The campaign book **MUST** be named `Dolmenwood Campaign Book 2022-06-28.pdf`.
        1. Other versions of the campaign book won't work because the Hex Descriptions start on a different page. I'll try to keep this updated as new versions come out.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. You should see the map on the left, and the Campaign book PDF on the right. If one of them doesn't show up, then you probably got the filename wrong. Make sure they match the examples EXACTLY!
4. Click on a hex in the map, and after a moment the PDF should switch to the page for that hex.

Enjoy!
